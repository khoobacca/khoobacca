Hey everyone! Welcome to my temporary blog!




# 2023/08/11
I'm an aerospace materials engineering student at UBC interested in all sorts of things!
When I'm not going to the gym, I like to keep up to date with world events and refine some analytic strategies for investing!

I'm excited to start my life since I left my home environment and now that I'm writing this I'll probably keep a log of what I'm up to!

Right now I'll keep a log of my day to day activities and what I'm up to.
I have 2 projects in mind for the coming months after I get onto the UAS drone design team at UBC and finish setting up my educational startup:
1. creating a portfolio website which will probably have a blog on it along with a mix of my other projects
2. creating an ai that is able to predict stock movements because why not
3. i'll probably upload some of my previous projects to github as well because why not!

I'm going to really hone my skills this year and take a break from startups and just create things and network.
I should get back to studying physics right now because I have a final coming up in a week and I need to apply for student loans, coop program, and work more on my start up
(we're launching in september and we need more clients) If you're reading this check out https://uprep.academy/
