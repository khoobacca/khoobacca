Hey everyone, welcome to my temporary blog!
I'm an aerospace materials engineering student at UBC interested in all sorts of things!
When I'm not going to the gym, I like to keep up to date with world events and refine some analytic strategies for investing!

Been a while since I wrote in this but I've been making progress on my data science project. pretty cool what i've learned so far and Ill just continue doing what I do. Im relearning python rn and ill see what happens

Berlin is really fun. I managed to read the paper through the past couple days and I'm now familiar with the model. I'm going to start learing how to find proper data, scrub it, and use python and any libraries ill need. Ill probably end up using gpt4 for alot of the coding.

Finals are finally done... That took a while but now I can focus on what I want to do. Im at the airport waiting for my flight to amsterdam with a layover to berlin so i have alot of time to relax and make commits.

Final in 2 days. going to come back to my project after.

Back to researching models of epidemiology... not too much. Maybe if i have time ill chill and start relearning python and data analytics.

# 2023/08/13 - Finals + Guten Tag!
I have my final in 4 days so I'll be spending a majority of my time on that, plus getting ready for a 2 week vacation to germany. My 2 focuses in germany will be my startup and the prediction software. I need to find a better name for my project. anyways, ill do a bit more research tonight and get up and grind tomorrow.

Update: im procrastinating physics which is bad. the good thing is im pretty excited about this project. Im still going to go to sleep early and get some rest but im gonna set up vsc first. Vsc done!

# 2023/08/12 - VSC and COVID-19 Prediction Software
I'll probably end up writing in this whenever I need to not every day we'll see.

Today I'm heading back to UBC later in the night so I'll see if I can get to uploading my prediction software by then. It's a good thing to start with because I haven't coded in a while and I need to set up VSC which was always a pain in the ass for me. Hopefully should take an hour or two total. After that I'm studying more then heading to the airport.

Definetly not productive today. Traveling always takes a while and I only managed to get a little research on epidemiology models done. I'm hosting a meeting for my startup tomorrow so I'll go to bed early and just grind out tomorrow. I really need to catch up on physics jesus.

# 2023/08/11 - DAY 1
I'm excited to start my life since I left my home environment and now that I'm writing this I'll probably keep a log of what I'm up to!

Right now I'll keep a log of my day to day activities and what I'm doing.
I have a couple projects in mind for the coming months after I get onto a design team at UBC and finish setting up my educational startup:
1. creating a portfolio website which will probably have a blog on it similar to what im writing (maybe the same) along with a mix of my other projects
2. creating an ai that is able to predict stock movements because why not
3. i'll probably upload some of my previous projects to github as well because why not!

I'm going to really hone my skills this year and take a break from startups and just create things and network. It's my first time on github so im pretty excited about keeping track of my progress through my projects.

I should get back to studying physics right now because I have a final coming up in a week and I need to apply for student loans, coop program, and work more on my start up. lots of things haha
(we're launching in september and we need more clients, so if you're reading this check out https://uprep.academy/)

I just did the github tutorial...still kinda confused but it is what it is lmao.

Not a bad after a bit of time. I'll start getting familiar with the platform by uploading some of my previous projects, starting with a COVID-19 prediction software I made back in grade 12
